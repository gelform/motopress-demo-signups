The signups page shows all emails. http://prntscr.com/eyv54l

Simple links at the top let you filter by status.

Each signup is color coded: yellow = pending, green = active, grey = archived

The email address is a mailto to email the user.

If a WordPress user has been created, there's a link to their profile (pencil icon).

If a sandbox has been created, there's a link (external icon). If it's pending, there's a link to the activation link but it can only be copied via right click (copy icon).

It shows when they signed up when they activated the demo when the demo expired.
